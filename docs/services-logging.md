# Services - logging

## Purpose

### Service

The logging service provides a common logging mechanism for all packages and services.

It listens for messages from the messaging service of type `LOG` and transmits these to the IBM
Cloud LogDNA instance.

The logging service is the ingestion point for all important output generated by other services.
This includes all relevant FFDC (First Failure Data Capture) information.

The purpose of FFDC is to collect enough information during the first occurrence of an issue to
provide a fix without needing to reproduce the failure and perform additional debug of the problem.

### Package

The logging package is responsible for facilitating data transfer between services and the
`logging-service`.

In production mode, it broadcasts messages to the messaging service with type `LOG`.

In development mode, logs are written to stdout or stderr, depending on the log type.

## Package API

### `Logging(component: string)`

Instantiates a `Logging` object with a given component name. All log messages given to this logging
instance will automatically include the component in the appropriate part of the resulting log
entry.

Component strings are typically service names or package names, but can be anything that uniquely
identifies an area of code.

### `Logging#debug(message: string)`

Logs a debugging message. This includes things like important function entry/exit, the size of a
list obtained from a remote source, the results after filtering an input set, etc.

> NOTE: Debug messaging is enabled in local and test environments, but not in the production
> environment. It is safe an acceptable to leave debug statements in code, where appropriate, unlike
> `console.log` statements, which would typically be removed from production code.

**Examples**

```ts
logging.debug(`Pre-filter list size: ${orig.length}, Post-filter list size: ${filtered.length}`)
```

```ts
function someImportantOperation(inputValue: string): boolean {
  logging.debug(`-> someImportantOperation args: ${inputValue}`)

  // ...

  logging.debug(`<- someImportantOperation ${result}`)
  return result
}
```

### `Logging#info(message: string)`

Logs an informational message. This is useful for point-in-time events, such as a service becoming
ready, a user account being created, a configuration setting being updated, a new data ingestion
endpoint becoming available, etc.

**Examples**

```ts
logging.info(`Web server now listening on port ${port}`)
```

### `Logging#warn(message: string)`

Logs a warning message. Warnings are typically unexpected situations, but do not represent a
breakdown of the core application logic. Examples include a user account becoming locked due to
failed login attempts, encountering an expected file that cannot be found or is blank, usages of
deprecated APIs, an operation taking longer than expected, etc.

**Examples**

```ts
logging.warn(`Database collection ${collection.name} was empty. Recreating`)
```

### `Logging#error(message: string, exception?: object)`

Logs an error message. Errors are unexpected situations and often represent a breakdown in core
logic. This often means entering the `catch` block of a `try/catch` statement. It can also mean
encountering `undefined` or `null` where values are expected to be present.

**Examples**

```ts
try {
  const dbConnection = db.connect()
  dbConnection.query('stuff')
} catch (err) {
  logging.error(`Could not connect to database`, err)
}
```

```ts
error(`processImage encountered a checksum mismatch. Expected: ${expected}, Was: ${actual}`)
```
