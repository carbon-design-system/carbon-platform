## About Carbon

### What is the Carbon Design System?

Carbon is IBM’s design system for products and digital experiences. With the IBM Design Language as
its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources, human interface
guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors.

To learn more about the Carbon ecosystem, check out
[how Carbon works](/about-carbon/how-carbon-works).

### What is Carbon Next?

Carbon Next is a project to create a new version of the Carbon website, as well as new
infrastructure to support indexing and maintaining assets. This will eventually replace the existing
Carbon and PAL websites.

Check out the [platform roadmap](/about-carbon/platform-roadmap) to learn more about planned
releases.

### Why is the Carbon website changing?

In the past, open and inner source assets were scattered across multiple websites. The new site
provides a unified discovery experience, which helps designers and developers find and access
components, patterns, functions and templates across all IBM teams. This will help everyone find
assets that comply with platform requirements, are convenient to implement, and are consistent with
design patterns across the company.

## Creating with Carbon

### Where do I start if I’m a developer?

Explore the [developer getting started guide](/developing) to learn about libraries and access
everything you need to get up and running with your preferred framework — React, Angular, Web
Components, Vue, or Svelte.

### Where do I start if I’m a designer?

Check out the [designer getting started guide](/designing/get-started) to learn how design kits are
used to build consistent, scalable user interfaces — and get started with your design tool of
choice, including Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, or Axure.

### Which assets can I use?

Anyone can use the core system, which includes elements, assets, code, design kits, and guidelines
intended as a base for the widest variety of situations. These assets are open source and can be
easily extended or adapted.

Some local systems are open source while others require IBM employee authentication to view.

Catalogs for [components](/assets/components), [patterns](/assets/patterns),
[functions](/assets/functions), and [templates](/assets/templates) allow you to explore everything
Carbon has to offer, with filters to find exactly what you need.

### Where can I find documentation for earlier versions of Carbon?

You can find earlier versions of Carbon documentation here:
**[V6](https://v6.carbondesignsystem.com/)**, **[V7](https://v7.carbondesignsystem.com/)**,
**[V8](https://v8.carbondesignsystem.com/)**, **[V9](https://v9.carbondesignsystem.com/)**, and
**[V10](https://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/)**. Browser support is on a per-library basis and Carbon
V11 does not support Internet Explorer 11.

### How can I contribute to new components, guidelines, or fixes?

Contributors are members of the community who contribute to Carbon in a material way. Anyone can be
a contributor. Check out our [contribution overview](/contributing/overview) to learn all about the
different ways to contribute or
[create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose) to report
something that isn’t working correctly. Thanks for the help!

## Accessibility

### Is the Carbon Design System accessible?

IBM firmly believes that web and software experiences should be accessible for everyone. Carbon is
committed to following and complying with accessibility best practices.

Carbon components follow the
[IBM accessibility checklist](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/?_ga=2.226507220.899498654.1661181268-592751643.1649883372)
which is based on WCAG AA, Section 508, and European standards. The Carbon team strives to write
perceivable, operable, and understandable patterns for all users—including those employing a screen
reader or other assistive technology.

### What should I do if I find a component that isn’t accessible?

First, refer to the [accessibility guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) to confirm that
the component fails accessibility standards. If confirmed,
[create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose) in the
Components repo and describe the steps to reproduce the problem. If the asset maintainer confirms
the problem, they will work to fix it as quickly as possible.

## Telemetry

### What is telemetry and why is it useful?

Telemetry is a feature that collects anonymous usage information for IBM and Carbon Design System
properties. Usage data is used to prioritize updates to the website and is also visible on a
per-library and per-asset basis on the website to help all maintainers prioritize usage decisions
for their assets.

### When is data collected?

Data is only collected when Carbon packages are installed on a Continuous Integration (CI) server,
when the installation is not part of a Pull Request (PR), and for Git repositories with the origin
remotes:

- `github.ibm.com`
- `github.com/ibm`
- `github.com/carbon-design-system`

As the information collected is not anonymous, telemetry data collection is limited to IBM GitHub
Enterprise repositories, as well as open source repositories in the IBM and Carbon Design System
GitHub organizations.

### What is being collected?

The following is collected through a postinstall script:

- Git repository remote origin URLs and commit hashes
- Packages and package versions used in the repository
- Components being used including file paths and their packages
- Component props being used (the prop value is only collected when it is serializable to a string)

### How do I opt out?

Participation in Carbon’s telemetry is optional. To opt-out, set the environment variable
`CARBON_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` to `1`.
