We use the field validation errors available in Carbon components like Number Input and Text Input, but noticed that Checkbox Group and Radio Group do not have these options. We understand that this is not a great UX, but due to the limits of our ability to change existing business logic (as it is high risk and impacts unpredictable customization done by customers) we require a solution for these controls to display errors at the base level. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\nIBM creates a Maximo app with a large form that supports options A, B, C but a customer on the server back end creates a script that says  \"B can only be selected if field X is set to Z\". On saving the form, the user would then receive an error message, but no inline identification of what field caused that error.\r\n\r\n### Desired UX and success metrics\r\n\r\n<!--alex disable failure-->\r\n\r\nUser can receive a custom error message and identify the selection that caused the error so that they can rectify it\r\nPasses accessibility requirements (I'm not sure if my suggestion even does this)\r\n<!--alex enable failure-->\r\n\r\n### Available extra resources\r\n\r\nWhat resources do you have to assist this effort?\r\nI have development resources willing to submit code, once they have an approved design to go from.\r\n\r\nQuick exploration:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-02-18 at 1 14 16 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21066152/74767318-a825c700-5254-11ea-8981-9c0c4ca9cb32.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5390/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6193","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6193/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6193/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6193/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6193","id":630275257,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MzAyNzUyNTc=","number":6193,"title":"Create example for Checkbox selection group","user":{"login":"joshblack","id":3901764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3901764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshblack","html_url":"https://github.com/joshblack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshblack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshblack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshblack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshblack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshblack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshblack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshblack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshblack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshblack/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20enhancement%20%F0%9F%92%A1","name":"type: enhancement üí°","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1056028599,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20docs%20%F0%9F%93%96","name":"type: docs üìñ","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1354806576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzU0ODA2NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/package:%20react","name":"package: react","color":"d4bbff","default":false,"description":"carbon-components-react"},{"id":1382571883,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzgyNTcxODgz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/package:%20components","name":"package: components","color":"d4bbff","default":false,"description":"carbon-components"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-06-03T19:42:51Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T19:42:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Over in https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/pull/1245 we received a PR that adds in guidance for nested checkboxes.
