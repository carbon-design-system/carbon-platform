But the Histogram is a far better representation for this kind of data.\r\n\r\nOur query can group by those rows and count. So we would rather send total value of a particular group instead of the raw data.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to produce the issue\r\n\r\nInstead of sending each row like this:\r\n`{\r\n\t\t\"group\": \"Dataset 1\",\r\n\t\t\"age\": 20\r\n},\r\n{\r\n\t\t\"group\": \"Dataset 1\",\r\n\t\t\"age\": 20\r\n}`\r\n\r\nWe want to send he aggregated values like in the Lolipop:\r\n`{\r\n\t\t\"group\": \"Dataset 1\",\r\n\t\t\"key\": \"20\",\r\n\t\t\"value\": 2\r\n}`\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPerhaps both behabiours could be preserved and configured via Options? Something like \"mode\":  \"raw\" | \"aggregated\" = \"raw\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an important optimization for us. For now we're staying with the Lolipop version.\r\n\r\nStill, we're very happy with Carbon Charts!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1128/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1}]}}
