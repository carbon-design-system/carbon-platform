# Services - logging-service

The logging service provides a common logging mechanism for all packages and services.

It listens for messages from the messaging service of type `LOG` and transmits these to the IBM
Cloud LogDNA instance.

The logging service is the ingestion point for all important output generated by other services.
This includes all relevant FFDC (First Failure Data Capture) information.

The purpose of FFDC is to collect enough information during the first occurrence of an issue to
provide a fix without needing to reproduce the failure and perform additional debug of the problem.
