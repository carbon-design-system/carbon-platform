This pattern builds on that for the case where category labels are necessary to make scanning options easier. \r\n\r\nWhen To Use: \r\n• Only use this option if there is a reasonable number of options that makes categorizing necessary \r\n• Include a search field in the menu to make finding an option easier and faster \r\n• Sub-groups are optional \r\n• Avoid categories that have fewer than 3 options\r\n<img width=\"219\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-04-13 at 12 02 59 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96617414/163114469-087ce309-0496-489d-b30f-b45cf4c9ed18.png\">\r\n1.\tSearch bar \r\n2.\tCategory label: productive-heading-01 \r\n3.

\r\nUse sub-categories when there are many options under categories and, to make scanning easier. \r\n\r\nKeyboard Accessibility:  \r\nUsers can tab through the checkbox and primary/secondary buttons. \r\nUp and down arrows activated once focus is inside the options area to navigate up or down. \r\nOption can be activated by clicking on enter/return.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/11220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/11220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10415","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10415/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10415/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10415/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10415","id":1101969736,"node_id":"I_kwDOBQ58z85BrrlI","number":10415,"title":"Dropdown:

Summary\r\n\r\nIf a dropdown is used within a scrollable area they will be cut off by the surrounding container.

Menus can also be divided into categories following the “overflow menu” pattern.\r\n\r\n![AB1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96617414/148364144-1eac3510-c463-41d6-8075-3ca4e100f531.png)\r\n_Current pattern with action-buttons in the tool bar of a default window size_\r\n\r\n![AB2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96617414/148364202-4a8129b2-04dd-4053-8a19-229f4af48b0d.png)\r\n_New pattern with menu-buttons in the tool bar of a default window size_\r\n\r\n![AB3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96617414/148364328-a488ad09-645e-4f49-9d50-f9adcdcd8e6d.png)\r\n_New pattern with an open dropdown menu in the tool bar_\r\n\r\n![AB4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96617414/148364405-32efd5ac-3b47-455c-9a08-a937e29207ae.png)\r\n_New pattern with use of mixed action-buttons and menu-button in the toolbar_\r\n\r\n**When to use**\r\nThis pattern would be used when there isn’t enough space on the toolbar to accommodate the list of actions. This could be because -\t\r\n• there are too many actions (more than 5) -\t\r\n• one or more action labels are long (by default or when translated) \r\n• the design needs to respond to a narrow window size (overflow menu)\r\n\r\n**When not to use** \r\nThis pattern should not be used if there is enough space to accommodate the actions as buttons in a default window size. \r\n\r\n**Behaviors**\r\nButton states : Enabled, hover, active, focus and disabled menu-button states should be the same as the action-button (also Carbon primary button and Cloud menu button)\r\n\r\n**Menu states:**\t\r\n• Open and close behaviors should be consistent with the Carbon “overflow” menu behaviors (also Cloud menu button)\r\n• Open and close motion of the menu should be consistent with the Carbon “overflow” menu (also Cloud menu button) \r\n• Enabled, hover, active, focus and disabled menu states should be the same as the overflow menu (also Cloud button menu)\r\n\r\n![AB5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96617414/148365173-b86bc35b-91fe-4b9d-8402-d1516468e133.png)\r\nExample of “active” button state, divided menu\r\n\r\n**Best practices** \r\nLimit the number of menu-buttons to the amount that can be accommodated in a default window size. \r\nFollow current Carbon standards for content:\r\n• Button labels should be noun (not verb), and they should accurately describe the options contained in the menu \r\n• Menu options should be verb+noun and should be clear and concise. They should match the tear sheet, slide-in or confirmation window title.\r\n\r\n**Keyboard Accessibility** \r\nFollow existing accessibility guidelines for the data table, actions toolbar and overflow menu.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6986","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6986/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6986/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6986/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6986","id":716225748,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MTYyMjU3NDg=","number":6986,"title":"Dropdown options announcing repeatedly and in in-between on JAWS","user":{"login":"dhashmi-madmax","id":72486229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDg2MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72486229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhashmi-madmax","html_url":"https://github.com/dhashmi-madmax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhashmi-madmax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhashmi-madmax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhashmi-madmax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhashmi-madmax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhashmi-madmax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhashmi-madmax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhashmi-madmax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhashmi-madmax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhashmi-madmax/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028613,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NjEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20a11y%20%E2%99%BF","name":"type: a11y ♿","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1692677746,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkyNjc3NzQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/component:%20dropdown","name":"component: dropdown","color":"a6c8ff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-10-07T06:05:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T15:05:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Title line template: [Title]: Brief description\r\n\r\nIn react application, I have used carbon-component-react Dropdown component.
