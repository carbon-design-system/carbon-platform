Summary\r\n\r\nThe Cloud & Cognitive data table workstream is requesting additional data table toolbar heights in order to match the available row heights. \r\n\r\nCurrently there are 4 possible row heights for data tables (with a 5th height coming in Carbon 11):\r\n\r\n- Compact 24px\r\n- Short 32px\r\n- Default 48px\r\n- Tall 64px\r\n\r\nHowever there are only two toolbar heights, 32px and 48px. The majority of row heights will have to be paired with a clashing toolbar. We are asking for development support to add additional toolbar heights, so that the toolbar height always matches the row height. \r\n\r\n**As-Is: 24px row height with 32px toolbar and 48px pagination bar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/121441734-fa11c500-c94f-11eb-961b-bce2ef716633.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Proposed: All components are 24px**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/121441759-01d16980-c950-11eb-8956-359d588842c6.png)\r\n\r\n**Note:** this issue is not as high a priority as [Provide pagination bar heights to match new data table row heights #8874](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/8874).  For MVP we could just add a 32px pagination height. The compact toolbar size (24px) is tricky as Carbon does not currently offer 24px search or buttons.\r\n\r\n**MVP option: 24px row height with 32px toolbar and 48px pagination bar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/121441853-29283680-c950-11eb-84e6-5ad978d4fa8d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Justification\r\n\r\n- We are rolling out the table settings feature more widely, which means that these alternative heights will begin to be more heavily used, and the visual inconsistencies will become more obvious. \r\n\r\n- Today,  if a user switches to the 24px row height, their pagination will still be 48px, and their toolbar will be 32px. It would be nice to have consistency across these elements.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 6 13 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/121441970-55dc4e00-c950-11eb-8bef-69e289d6c51c.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Desired UX and success metrics\r\n\r\nIf a user switches row height, the table toolbar would switch to matching height.\r\n\r\n### \"Must have\" functionality\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Specific timeline issues / requests\r\n\r\nIdeally it would be great to roll this out with Carbon 11 as we introduce the new row heights. We would love to roll this update into the data table settings feature being worked on by the Cloud & Cognitive data table workstream.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Available extra resources\r\n\r\nWe can provide design support and potentially some dev support.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/8875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/8875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10459","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10459/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10459/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10459/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10459","id":1106404623,"node_id":"I_kwDOBQ58z85B8mUP","number":10459,"title":"[a11y]:

If we don't add this functionality to the Carbon data table, users will lose that existing functionality when our platform moves to Carbon X. \r\n\r\nIn general, filtering is a core table functionality, but Carbon lacks a table filtering component. As a result, teams have implemented filters in conflicting ways, causing user confusion and highlighting internal divisions.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, the filter display bar also allows users to view their filter selections, a key user need that they are not able to accomplish with the current multi-select filter design (the current component simply displays a count). This feature has tested very well with internal and external users.\r\n\r\n### Specs:\r\n\r\n**Desktop**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73022241-c41d8080-3dee-11ea-9fe8-a47289bcdb63.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73022250-c7187100-3dee-11ea-8d8e-2f61c25030fb.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73022260-d13a6f80-3dee-11ea-8dd4-ca537a1e51b2.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73022302-f3cc8880-3dee-11ea-9fe1-42a3037a3ac9.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73022312-f929d300-3dee-11ea-9993-d1f99ca8070a.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73022320-fcbd5a00-3dee-11ea-85aa-7fec61b9b204.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73022325-00e97780-3def-11ea-988f-73246eed5db1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Tablet (672px)**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73022518-60478780-3def-11ea-9583-013ad427a68f.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73023391-0d6ecf80-3df1-11ea-8f9f-5df8c263592c.png)\r\n\r\n**Mobile (320px)**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73022619-8ec56280-3def-11ea-85de-774d461f92f6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73019239-d3013480-3de8-11ea-80dc-819e9dc8d627.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/73023404-1364b080-3df1-11ea-8355-9e4088e13d2b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Desired UX and success metrics\r\n\r\nThe desired UX is that users can easily discover, apply, and view their filters. Users should be able to see and easily remove one or all of their filter selections.\r\n\r\nFor users that already enjoy this feature on Softlayer tables, the goal is to preserve existing functionality. As a success metric for this feature, we will **track clicks on the filter icon**, as well as use amplitude to track the number of users who use filters on pages where this panel has been implemented.\r\n\r\n### \"Must have\" functionality\r\n\r\n- The panel can incorporate any single-line Carbon text field or dropdown \r\n- The panel can accommodate batch or live filtering (use \"apply\" as primary button for batch and \"done\" as primary button for live)\r\n- The designer can designate additional filters to go under \"view more filters\"\r\n- Filter selection tags include filter label (eg. location: Dallas 01)\r\n- Designer can choose 3 or 4 column layout\r\n- **The filter panel and display bar are responsive**, with optimized layouts for tablet and mobile (see above). **This design requires a larger version of the overflow menu in order to fit the larger overflow icon.** (see above)\r\n- The filter display bar can be used with batch actions (see above image with blue batch action bar)\r\n- The filter panel and bar are keyboard and screen reader accessible\r\n- If filter selections cannot all fit in display bar, an overflow count is displayed. The user can click on this count to get a tooltip with listing the \"overflow\" filter selections.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Specific timeline issues / requests\r\n\r\nThis work is related to the CloudPAL-sponsored project to contribute back a more robust data table to Carbon by mid-December, as part of Carbon X / CloudPAL adoption. As such, we have a very tight timeline. We would like teams to be able to start consuming these tables at end of January.\r\n\r\nOur team is working closely with Carbon design and development and trying to anticipate accessibility concerns.\r\n\r\n### Available extra resources\r\nHolman from ICED development squad in Toronto, possibly CloudPAL developers. Holman is currently working on developing this feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5264","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5264/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5264/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5264/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5264","id":559864454,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NTk4NjQ0NTQ=","number":5264,"title":"[Table bx--data-table_inner-container static padding]: the padding-top for bx--data-table_inner-container (for sticky header) does not change with size","user":{"login":"HYACCCINT","id":44329917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzI5OTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44329917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYACCCINT","html_url":"https://github.com/HYACCCINT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYACCCINT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYACCCINT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYACCCINT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYACCCINT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYACCCINT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYACCCINT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYACCCINT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYACCCINT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYACCCINT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028595,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20bug%20%F0%9F%90%9B","name":"type: bug üêõ","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1056028601,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NjAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/severity:%204","name":"severity: 4","color":"ffb3b8","default":false,"description":"Affects minor functionality, no workaround needed"},{"id":1056028614,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NjE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/impact:%20low","name":"impact: low","color":"ffb784","default":false,"description":"Affects one or a few users"},{"id":1692677297,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkyNjc3Mjk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/component:%20data-table","name":"component: data-table","color":"a6c8ff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-02-04T17:18:59Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T19:11:59Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!-- Feel free to remove sections that aren't relevant.\r\n\r\n## Title line template: \r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What package(s) are you using?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Add an x in one of the options below, for example:\r\n- [x] package name\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ x ] `carbon-components`\r\n- [ ] `carbon-components-react`\r\n\r\n## Detailed description\r\n\r\n> Describe in detail the issue you're having.\r\nContinuation of https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/issues/1035\r\nthe padding-top css for class bx--data-table_inner-container is a static 3 rem for all sizes (short, normal, large, etc.) causing unwanted padding for any size other than normal.\r\n> Is this issue related to a specific component?\r\nData Table\r\n> What did you expect to happen?

Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a request to add **at least one additional pagination bar height (32px)** to match the available row heights in order to avoid clashing heights. \r\n\r\nCurrently there are 4 possible row heights for data tables:\r\n\r\n- Compact 24px\r\n- Short 32px\r\n- Default 48px\r\n- Tall 64px\r\n\r\nWith Carbon 11 there will also be a 5th height (Medium 40px) - see https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/8369.\r\n\r\nHowever we only have one pagination bar height, meaning that for most row heights, the pagination bar will look out of sync. The difference is most jarring on short and compact row heights.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for development support to add at least a 32px pagination bar height. \r\n\r\nIdeally we would have matching pagination and toolbar heights for any row height, but adding the 32px pagination bar is an excellent MVP.\r\n\r\n**As-Is**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/121440640-e9604f80-c94d-11eb-8460-f1fd525bc6d2.png)\r\n\r\n**Proposed**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/121440667-f3824e00-c94d-11eb-8693-c9482f39b46a.png)\r\n\r\n### Justification\r\n\r\nWe are rolling out the table settings feature more widely, which means that these alternative heights will begin to be more heavily used, making this visual inconsistency more obvious. \r\n\r\nAdding an additional pagination bar height will allow us to create visual harmony with minimal effort.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 6 13 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/121440923-74414a00-c94e-11eb-8587-32d7a9cbf476.png\">\r\n\r\n### Desired UX and success metrics\r\n\r\nWhen user switches to either a short (xs) or compact (sm) row height, the pagination bar would switch to a small height (32px). \r\n\r\nSame for data table toolbar - see related request [Provide data table toolbar heights to match new row heights #8875](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/8875)\r\n\r\n### \"Must have\" functionality\r\n\r\nEach of the pagination bar variations would have a 32px version.\r\n\r\n### Specific timeline issues / requests\r\n\r\nIdeally it would be great to roll this out with Carbon 11 as we introduce the new row heights. We would love to roll this update into the data table settings feature being worked on by the Cloud & Cognitive data table workstream.\r\n\r\n### Available extra resources\r\n\r\n We can provide design support and potentially some dev support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/8874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/8874/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6273","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6273/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6273/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6273/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6273","id":638350708,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MzgzNTA3MDg=","number":6273,"title":"DataTable - Is there a default template (based on data table columns) for adding a new row?","user":{"login":"zbeedatm","id":26740851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzQwODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26740851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbeedatm","html_url":"https://github.com/zbeedatm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbeedatm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbeedatm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbeedatm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbeedatm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbeedatm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbeedatm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbeedatm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbeedatm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbeedatm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028585,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20question%20%E2%9D%93","name":"type: question ‚ùì","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1692677297,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkyNjc3Mjk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/component:%20data-table","name":"component: data-table","color":"a6c8ff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-06-14T13:16:42Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T16:39:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHi there! üëã Hope everything is going okay using projects from the Carbon Design\r\nSystem.
