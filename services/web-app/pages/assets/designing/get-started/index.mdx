## Step 1: Learn about Carbon

Carbon translates the IBM Design Language into resources for building digital experiences. Watch the
video below to learn more.

### Understand the ecosystem

The following diagram shows the relationships of assets and guidance across IBM. The Carbon Design
System is often extended or complimented by additional product and digital systems.

## Step 2: Access design tools

IBMers should ask their team about which tool they should adopt and follow instructions in the
[Design toolbox]() to procure a software license. Carbon is supported on Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD,
and Axure.

## Step 3: Get the design kits

Design kits contain visual assets such as components and elements (iconography, color palettes,
etc.) as well as wireframes and guidance to aid designers.

They are also living, breathing documents. This means you’ll automatically get any updates made by
the Carbon team so you don’t need to go back and change any designs to match the latest release. And
when handing off to your developers there won’t be confusion about components and their behaviors.

The following illustration shows how design kits depend on one another.

### Tutorials

When you have access to your design tool of choice, head over to our tool-based tutorials to get
step-by-step guidance on installing the kits.

Everyone using Carbon should get the universal design kits, outlined in the table below. Universal
design kits include the IBM Design Language, Carbon themes, wireframes, and guidelines. Internal IBM
teams will need to get additional product and digital design kits which compliment and extend
Carbon.

### Universal design kits

### Poduct and digital design kits

## Step 4: Review foundational guidance

The following sites provide guidance for creating experiences that are consistent, provide an
interoperability of experience with other offerings, and represent IBM as a company.

**Take action:** Begin to familiarize yourself with foundational guidance.
