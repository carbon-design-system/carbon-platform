continuation of the v1 design specs for tree view https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5180\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n- Select a parent node without expanding the children so a user can see information tied to the parent node.\r\n\r\n- Motion specs for expanding and collapsing parent and rotating caret. \r\n\r\n- The ability to collapse all expanded nodes at once\r\n\r\n- Provide specs for additional icons in a node:\r\n- [ ] multiselect with checkbox. (Example image from Pascal Potvin - reach out to them for more requirements around this)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19270502/86835539-e421c300-c061-11ea-966f-4a1ab0f2234f.png)\r\n\r\n- [ ] overflow menu\r\n- [ ] drag and drop grabber icon\r\n- [ ] status indicator\r\n- [ ] number of nested children\r\n\r\n- Specs for an additional visual grouping element such as vertical lines.\r\n\r\n- Revisit selection state style for cmd+click multiselect. Consider using something more consistent with Carbon components like the dropdown select style. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Not explored yet (depending on requirements)\r\n- [ ] Geometry for actions on the nodes (checkbox, edit, drag). This depends on the requirements - not explored yet\r\n- [ ] Define the component's intended use: browsing file directory, as navigation?\r\n- [ ] Loading state when the children node content may take a while\r\n- [ ] What other types of content would need to be in a node. The number of children? (3)\r\n- [ ] Tree container to define the bounds of the tree, scrolling and docked node behavior, placement of additional functionality.\r\n- [ ] Search\r\n- [ ] Pagination\r\n- [ ] Entering different modes\r\n- [ ] drag and drop reordering/nesting\r\n- [ ] support for different selection styles, e.g. with checkboxes or directory style selection (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + click or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + click)\r\n\r\n### Variants to consider:\r\n- Different expand indicators (+/- and chevron)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19270502/73852027-1d74af00-47f4-11ea-96fd-abfb1039bd71.png)\r\n\r\n- Divider rules between nodes\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19270502/73852064-2a919e00-47f4-11ea-998c-c4cb3beceb04.png)\r\n\r\n- Graphical element for grouped children nodes (gray blocks like IoT, vertical rules like VS code)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19270502/73852187-5f9df080-47f4-11ea-9170-5002870254ff.png)\r\n\r\n- Docked parent nodes similar to VS code.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19270502/74957178-c9112800-53cc-11ea-8b3d-32be1582118b.png)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Should the vertical rules change or appear when the user hovers in the tree area? When a node is selected?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19270502/73853704-ec49ae00-47f6-11ea-8c42-96cf4106fb39.png)\r\n\r\n### Future functionality to be considered\r\n\r\n> **Multi select**\r\n> Selection in multi-select trees: Authors may implement either of two interaction models to support multiple selection: a recommended model that does not require the user to hold a modifier key, such as Shift or Control, while navigating the list or an alternative model that does require modifier keys to be held while navigating in order to avoid losing selection states.\r\n> Recommended selection model -- holding a modifier key while moving focus is not necessary:\r\n> Space: Toggles the selection state of the focused node.\r\n> Shift + Down Arrow (Optional): Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the next node.\r\n> Shift + Up Arrow (Optional): Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the previous node.\r\n> Shift + Space (Optional): Selects contiguous nodes from the most recently selected node to the current node.\r\n> Control + Shift + Home (Optional): Selects the node with focus and all nodes up to the first node. Optionally, moves focus to the first node.\r\n> Control + Shift + End (Optional): Selects the node with focus and all nodes down to the last node. Optionally, moves focus to the last node.\r\n> Control + A (Optional): Selects all nodes in the tree. Optionally, if all nodes are selected, it can also unselect all nodes.\r\n> Alternative selection model -- Moving focus without holding the Shift or Control modifier unselects all selected nodes except for the focused node:\r\n> Shift + Down Arrow: Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the next node.\r\n> Shift + Up Arrow: Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the previous node.\r\n> Control + Down Arrow: Without changing the selection state, moves focus to the next node.\r\n> Control + Up Arrow: Without changing the selection state, moves focus to the previous node.\r\n> Control + Space: Toggles the selection state of the focused node.\r\n> Shift + Space (Optional): Selects contiguous nodes from the most recently selected node to the current node.\r\n> Control + Shift + Home (Optional): Selects the node with focus and all nodes up to the first node. Optionally, moves focus to the first node.\r\n> Control + Shift + End (Optional): Selects the node with focus and all nodes down to the last node. Optionally, moves focus to the last node.\r\n> Control + A (Optional): Selects all nodes in the tree. Optionally, if all nodes are selected, it can also unselect all nodes.\r\n\r\n**Type ahead:**\r\n> Type-ahead is recommended for all trees, especially for trees with more than 7 root nodes:\r\n> Type a character: focus moves to the next node with a name that starts with the typed character.\r\n> Type multiple characters in rapid succession: focus moves to the next node with a name that starts with the string of characters typed.\r\n> * (Optional): Expands all siblings that are at the same level as the current node.\r\n\r\nHorizontally scroll within the tree container so I can read text that may be cropped.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave the ability to edit (create, update name, delete) any node.\r\n\r\nSee the loading state when children nodes may take a while to load.\r\n\r\nScroll up and down a tree inside a container and know there's more content above or below that isn't shown.\r\n\r\nHave the option to use a border bottom as a divider between nodes to help with visual grouping or to use no border bottom.\r\n\r\nDock the parent node on scroll so the user can always see the parent.\r\n\r\nHave the ability to take batch action on nodes so I can edit multiple at once.\r\n\r\nCan drag and drop a node anywhere in a tree to change its location.\r\n\r\nCan see the number of children inside a parent node without expanding the parent. For example, a number (3) representing the children. \r\n\r\nCan search a tree to find the node I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nCan adjust the viewing container's width so a user can read the text of deeply nested nodes. \r\n\r\nCan change the sort method and order so I can browse the data by any sort of metadata.
