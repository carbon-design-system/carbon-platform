## The Carbon ecosystem

Carbon is a system of systems. At the epicenter lies the core system, with elements, assets, code,
design kits, and guidelines intended as a base for the widest variety of situations. These assets
are open source and can be easily extended or adapted.

Teams at IBM also create local systems that depend on and extend the core system for specific use
cases. For example, [Carbon for IBM.com](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/) is a local system
that specializes in an editorial experience, whereas
[Carbon for IBM Products](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/) provides assets and
guidance specific to the product experience.

Some local systems are open source while others require IBM employee authentication to view.

It is recommended that you start with the core system and whichever local system is most relevant to
your team. Catalogs for [components](/assets/components), [patterns](/assets/patterns),
[functions](/assets/functions), and [templates](/assets/templates) allow you to explore everything
Carbon has to offer, with filters to find exactly what you need.

[designing](/designing/get-started) and [developing](/developing).

## Key terms

As Carbon has evolved, so has our language. Below are a few of the most commonly used terms.

**Elements** translate the IBM Design Language into resources for building digital experiences, such
as color tokens, type tokens, spacing tokens, the grid, and more.

**Guidelines** provide direction on critical topics such as accessibility and content and ensure
consistent user experiences that meet IBM's standards.

**Assets** are reusable resources such as components, patterns, functions, and templates. Assets
often have usage and accessibililty guidance, as well as styling specifications and code.

**Design kits** are the design counterpart to coded assets. Design kits are also used for creating
wireframes and guidelines.

**Libraries** package up and distribute assets, as every asset belongs to a library. Libraries have
compatible design kits.

## Maintainers

Carbon systems have maintainers that administer governance over content and resource visibility.
Libraries and design kits cite a maintaining team if an IBM team primarily maintains the resource.
If an individual or informal group is responsible for a resource, it will be listed as community
maintained.

Maintainers can control content and resource visibility through a metadata file that follows a
[schema](/contributing/schema). The schema helps us document each resource in a standardized way and
enables everything to be indexed by Carbon’s underlying platform.

The Carbon platform and website is maintained by the Carbon team. Progress on the new platform can
be found in the [roadmap](/about-carbon/platform-roadmap).
