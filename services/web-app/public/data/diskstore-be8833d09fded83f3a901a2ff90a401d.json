there! 👋 Hope everything is going okay using projects from the Carbon Design\r\nSystem. It looks like you might have a question about our work, so we wanted to\r\nshare a couple resources that you could use if you haven't tried them yet 🙂.\r\n\r\nIf you're an IBMer, we have a couple of Slack channels available across all IBM\r\nWorkspaces:\r\n\r\n- #carbon-design-system for questions about the Design System\r\n- #carbon-components for questions about component styles\r\n- #carbon-react for questions about our React components\r\n\r\nIf these resources don't work out, help us out by filling out a couple of\r\ndetails below!\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What package(s) are you using?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Add an x in one of the options below, for example:\r\n- [x] package name\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] `carbon-components`\r\n- [x] `carbon-components-react`\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nThe current DataTable is suitable for situations where you can download the entire dataset and use the built-in sorting mechanism.\r\nHowever, with large enough datasets, you must stream the data in a page at a time to prevent overloading either the client or the server.\r\nThis is incompatible with the current built-in sorting mechanism, because it only sorts the _page_.\r\nIt's preferable to simply retrieve the current sort state, i.e. \r\n```tsx\r\nconst [sortHeader, setSortHeader] = useState('created');\r\nconst [sortDirection, setSortDirection] = useState('None');\r\n\r\nconst [page, setPage] = useState(1);\r\nconst [pageSize, setPageSize] = useState(10);\r\nconst start = pageSize * (page - 1)\r\nconst end = start + pageSize\r\nconst { data } = useSWR([start, end, sortHeader, sortDirection, 'myDataset'], getDataset, {suspense: true});\r\n<DataTable \r\n    onSortChanged={(key: string, direction: 'ASC' | 'DESC' | 'None') => setSortHeader(key); setSortDirection(direction)}\r\n    ...\r\n/>\r\n```\r\nHowever, it doesn't seem to be possible to do so.\r\nA similar story applies to search.\r\nWhat is the best way to scale the DataTable component so that its various functionality works well when populated by a backend that can perform its own search/sort/etc?\r\n## Relevant information\r\nFor the early stages of my work, I intend to just retrieve the entire dataset since it is still small.\r\nIn the future, a feature may end up being requested that requires this functionality.\r\n<!-- Provide as much useful information as you can -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6373/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6373/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/3489","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/3489/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/3489/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/3489/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/3489","id":471224297,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzEyMjQyOTc=","number":3489,"title":"Search component is missing a CTA","user":{"login":"kosruben","id":47223306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjIzMzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47223306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kosruben","html_url":"https://github.com/kosruben","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kosruben/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kosruben/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kosruben/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kosruben/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kosruben/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kosruben/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kosruben/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kosruben/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kosruben/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20enhancement%20%F0%9F%92%A1","name":"type: enhancement 💡","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1056028600,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/role:%20visual%20%F0%9F%8E%A8","name":"role: visual 🎨","color":"82cfff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1382571883,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzgyNTcxODgz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/package:%20components","name":"package: components","color":"d4bbff","default":false,"description":"carbon-components"},{"id":1692682039,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkyNjgyMDM5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/component:%20search","name":"component: search","color":"a6c8ff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1733172323,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzMzMTcyMzIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/proposal:%20accepted","name":"proposal: accepted","color":"6fdc8c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2376488653,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzc2NDg4NjUz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/Hacktoberfest","name":"Hacktoberfest","color":"ff832b","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2019-07-18T08:48:14Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T22:40:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Detailed description\r\n\r\nThe [Search component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/search/code) does not have a button to perform the search.
