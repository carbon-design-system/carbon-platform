## Rectangular charts

Most data visualizations are rectangular charts, with two dimensions represented on a vertical and a
horizontal axis. Rectangular charts are typically constructed with a set of common elements
including a legend, axis titles, and navigation tools like a zoom bar and tooltip.

#### Titles, labels, and legends

The title of a piece of visualization should be descriptive and qualitative. It should also reflect
the main insight the data reveals. The legend should explain the chart’s meaning by defining the
association of each visual property, such as color, shape, and size, to the corresponding data. When
possible, use labels directly on the chart to avoid long legends. All the text should be concise and
easy to understand. [Read more on legend usage.](/data-visualization/legends)

#### Tooltips

A tooltip is a message that appears when a cursor is positioned over an element, such as a data
point, icon button, or truncated text. By default, tooltips show on hover to reveal more detailed
information or context for specific chart elements. A tooltip should repeat the corresponding values
of the data point on both axes and any other relevant details.

#### Graph frames, axes, and ticks

The graph frame is the area where the data will be visualized as graphics or numbers. Axes, ticks,
and the grid should help the reader understand the proportions and scale of the data, the indicators
involved, and their unit of measure. Avoid filling the chart frame with too many elements, as it
impacts the user’s ability to interpret the data.

## Circular charts

Circular charts are primarily pie and donut charts. Other circular layout charts include radar and
solar charts.

    6. Big number
  </Aside>
</Column>
</Grid>

#### Labels

In a circular chart, labels offer the percentage value of the whole for an individual category. When
the graphic translation of the data is less than 3 degrees, a callout is used to clearly associate
the label with the slice. If the data translates as less than 1 degree, a slice will not be rendered
on the chart, the data would not be keyboard accessible or available in a tooltip either. The only
way to see the data in this scenario would be via a data table, a feature that we'd like to
implement for all charts to enhance accessibility.

#### Big number or KPI

A key performance indicator (KPI) consists of a number with a single word description. Examples
include “15,250 browsers”, “\$1.3M revenue”, or “Total 450”. A big number inside the donut chart may
be used to display a total sum or the individual count of a slice upon interaction. This element can
also be used independently on a dashboard (though please note this component is still a WIP and not
available outside the donut chart).
