#4981 \r\n\r\nAt the highest level tables vs. grids can be (clumsily) summed up as:\r\n- a **table**'s default semantics should be used for simply displaying non-interactive tabular data (this does not imply or include per-cell keyboard navigation)\r\n- adding the **grid** role (and other complimentary aria) would imply to user's with a screen reader that they're up against some kind of widget with Excel-like features (sorting, menus, selection etc) organized logically in a grid\r\n\r\nOur Datatable as it stands can satisfy one or the other of those criteria.\r\n\r\nIf the goal is improved
