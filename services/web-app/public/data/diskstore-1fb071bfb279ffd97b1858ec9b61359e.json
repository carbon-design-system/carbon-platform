My application supports 10 languages so we have a situation where the labelText for some of the `<ProgressStep>` components is long.  So I was able to easily fix this because the default for the step text (**bx--progress-label**) was `white-space: nowrap;` which I changed to `white-space: normal`\r\nBut the problem comes in when I have specified secondaryLabelText (**bx--progress-optional**) for a step and the step text wraps or is long and shows an overflow.  The problem is that the secondaryLabelText has an absolute position which assumes that the labelText will _always_ be one line of text or never wrapping.  With our application, some of the text of the step labels tend to be long and they overflow (which by default shows an ellipsis) due to translation.  If I modify the style of the `<ProgressStep>` labelText so it wraps, then the secondaryLabelText gets overlapped.\r\n\r\n### Normal circumstances\r\n<img width=\"1022\" alt=\"image\"

of the steps having secondary label text.\r\n- Either create the step label text to be really long or resize/reduce the size of your browser until the step label text extends into the area of the

positioning of secondary labels so I have to adding custom padding/margins below but the problem is if you have long secondary labels and user window sizes, word wrapping makes the height less predictable.\r\n\r\n> Is this issue related to a specific component?\r\n\r\nProgressIndicator\r\n\r\n> What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? What would you like to\r\n> see changed?\r\n\r\nPositioning is relative so thee full component takes up vertical space.\r\n\r\n> What browser are you working in?\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n> What version of the Carbon Design System are you using?\r\n\r\nlatest\r\n\r\n> What offering/product do you work on?

Only primary label takes up space.\r\n\r\n> Please create a reduced test case in CodeSandbox\r\n>\r\n> - Style and vanilla JS:\r\n>   https://codesandbox.io/s/github/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/components/examples/codesandbox\r\n> - React:\r\n>   https://codesandbox.io/s/github/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/react/examples/codesandbox\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\n- Screenshots or code\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/white-cherry-nme5n?file=/index.js\r\n- Notes\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1}]}}
