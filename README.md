## Getting started

If you're just getting started, here are some links so you can learn more about what we're working
on and what we have planned for the future.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| Process | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Releases](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-platform/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open) | Releases are documented as GitHub Milestones and are organized by time-based deliverables. Each release has an estimated release date and a description of high-level outcomes. GitHub Milestones contain GitHub Issues. |
| [Sprints](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-design-system/projects/36/views/5) | The team's two-week sprints are managed through a GitHub Project board. Each sprint tracks GitHub Issues through to completion. |
| [Epics](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-platform/issues?q=label%3A%22type%3A+epic+%F0%9F%8F%94%22+) | Epics are documented as GitHub Issues with the `type: epic üèî` label and contain Issues related by subject. As epics are not related by time, epics can span multiple sprints. |
| [Issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-platform/issues) | GitHub Issues are the team's smallest unit of work and are typically labeled by `type:` (e.g. bug or enhancement), `role:` (which skillsets are required to complete) and if the Issue is a bug, its `impact:` (how many users are affected) and `severity:` (what functionality is affected.) |
| [Issues by Release](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-design-system/projects/36/views/1) | The GitHub Project view grouped by Milestone. |
| [Roadmap](https://airtable.com/shrshl3XOeeT4Uxq0) | A visual overview of the releases and their epics. The roadmap will get migrated from Airtable to a public GitHub Project when a timeline view is available in the GitHub Projects beta. |
