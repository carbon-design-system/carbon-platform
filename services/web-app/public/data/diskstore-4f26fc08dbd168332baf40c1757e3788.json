But for Web components, I think we are still unclear how to fix the bug: \n\nCurrently, when button label wraps, icon becomes middle aligned: \n![image.png](https://images.zenhubusercontent.com/5be09c3a6102900c6d16d991/950b0071-939f-444f-863e-7cc667868be1)\n\nExpecting: \n![image.png](https://images.zenhubusercontent.com/5be09c3a6102900c6d16d991/a2620a84-400d-4f24-ae88-c7e5cc7706dd)\n\n### Additional information\n\n1. There is a **Button expressive** in Web components of Carbon for IBM.com library. We are not sure if it's still being used: \nhttps://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/master/packages/web-components/src/components/button\n\n2. [Carbon react button](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--playground) has been evolving and recently gained the `isExpressive` prop. I'm not sure if this is carried over to [Carbon web component button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--default)\n\n3. Ideally, Carbon for IBM.com should not have any buttons. We should take buttons from upstream Carbon react & Carbon web components.
