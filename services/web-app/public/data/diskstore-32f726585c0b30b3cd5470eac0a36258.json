Because the item with focus is being deleted, where should the focus go?\r\nIn prior discussions, the thought was to go the former item in the tab order. Until the delete buttons are distinguishable programmatically (#11198) it definitely makes more sense to put it on the File add button. And even once that is resolved, I think it may be a more consistent experience to always go to the File upload button regardless of which file has been delete \r\n\r\nWe'd previously discussed the notion of a group of controls. Perhaps an interactive parent should be part of the algorithm. This same algorithm could work for table row deletions, menu item deletions and the file uploaded group of files situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### WCAG 2.1 Violation\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html\n\n### CodeSandbox example\n\nhttps://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-fileuploader--drag-and-drop-upload-container-example-application\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

It is probably better to just expose this error message as a modal. It would never appear in the list because it wasn't uploaded. That would involve design, but is the recommended approach.\r\n\r\nBarring that, putting both the error and  the message into an alert region and making it an aria-describedby of the delete button would accomplish it, I think.\r\n>File size exceeds limit\r\n500kb max file size.

The following screenshots are of the existing behavior in App Connect which hasn't yet been migrated to the new pattern (much of App Connect already has has been, with workarounds to address the limitations of the current pattern). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"432\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39956961/92139485-b231a080-ee07-11ea-8998-ae3510b2ea85.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see below, the single file that has been provided for upload is shown in the context of the drop target, with the option to clear it. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"437\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39956961/92137838-93caa580-ee05-11ea-9b1d-f1c702b0d7c8.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThis works well in a scenario like the one shown in the example because the user also has the option to provide a URL for the file (which then disables the drop target)...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carbon is a collaborative system. We encourage teams to build components and\r\nsubmit them for integration as either add-ons or core components._\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6775/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6775/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1}]}}
