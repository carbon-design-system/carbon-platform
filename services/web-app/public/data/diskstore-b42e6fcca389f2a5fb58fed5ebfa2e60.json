Summary\n\nShow selected items in a MultiSelect field removing the need to open the dropdown to see what is selected.\n\n### Justification\n\nUsers and engineers have requested this feature in alpha and beta testing.\r\n\r\nIf a MultiSelect is disabled and there are items within that are selected, how is a user supposed to know what those items are?\n\n### Desired UX and success metrics\n\nTemplate:\r\n![Template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18297826/148283354-990ca8e8-1900-48d3-8eef-1eb9ec1ccd42.png)\r\n\r\nConcept

changed but the functionality is there - the selected items are shown within the field itself without the need to expand the dropdown to see what is selected.\r\n\r\nTo generate this concept I put in a workaround to concatenate the display names of the selected items into a label:\r\n```tsx\r\nconst label = initialSelectedItems\r\n  .map((item: MultiSelectItem) => item.display)\r\n  .join(', ');\r\n\r\nreturn <MultiSelect label={label} initialSelectedItems={initialSelectedItems} ... />;\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Required functionality\n\n_No response_\n\n### Specific timeline issues /

I expect this component to have a similar return type to checkbox or radio tiles onChange functions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think it would be great if Selectable Tile is offered as a standalone component (Current state) as well as a multi select (Similar to radio tile which is wrapped in tile group).

Also, the event target varies based on where the user clicks (Label or the checkbox SVG), making it difficult to retrieve the target.value/name. \r\n\r\nAs for a multiselect wrapper component around the selectable component feature, it would be really nice to have.

Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, rows in the data table component allow selection by clicking the checkbox. However, teams from CPD services such as WKC and WS would like the additional option to select the row by hovering and then clicking on it.\r\n\r\n### Justification\r\n\r\nCurrently, the row enters a hover status when the cursor is on it. Selecting the row requires the user to move the cursor to the left to find the checkbox.\r\n\r\n### Desired ux and success metrics\r\nThe desired ux is for the users to be able to select the the row by clicking on the empty space of a row. This is without having to find the checkbox. We argue that this is an understandable enhancement since an obvious next step to reading the content of a row is to select it. This is in addition to existing checkbox selection functionality.\r\n\r\n### “Must have” functionality\r\nThe functionality described above is simply an enhancement to the hover state by adding interactivity. This would exist alongside checkbox selection functionality. Clicking the empty space of a selected row would unselect it.\r\n \r\n### Specific timeline issues / requests\r\nServices have already implemented this or are targeting their fall releases for it. We would like for it to be formally recognized by carbon as an option for compliance reasons.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5645","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5645/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5645/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5645/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/5645","id":583183503,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODMxODM1MDM=","number":5645,"title":"Tooltip for select all check box in data tables","user":{"login":"ashok-magar","id":45493032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDkzMDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45493032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashok-magar","html_url":"https://github.com/ashok-magar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashok-magar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashok-magar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashok-magar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashok-magar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashok-magar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashok-magar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashok-magar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashok-magar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashok-magar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20enhancement%20%F0%9F%92%A1","name":"type: enhancement 💡","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1692677297,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkyNjc3Mjk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/component:%20data-table","name":"component: data-table","color":"a6c8ff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1733172323,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzMzMTcyMzIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/proposal:%20accepted","name":"proposal: accepted","color":"6fdc8c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2376488653,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzc2NDg4NjUz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/Hacktoberfest","name":"Hacktoberfest","color":"ff832b","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-03-17T17:37:11Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T22:40:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Summary\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we can have a tooltip for select all checkbox in data tables.\r\nWe are currently having a custom implementation in Objects table in COS UI.\r\n\r\nIt's just an implementation request, because we don't want to apply any hacks by adding any divs directly under tr or not having td directly under th.\r\n\r\n### Justification\r\n\r\nSometimes it's really good to indicate user what's gonna happen on click of a button, so a tooltip on hover is good.\r\n\r\n### Desired UX and success metrics\r\n\r\n### \"Must have\" functionality\r\n\r\nHighlight any \"must have\" needs and functionality for the request.\r\n\r\nThis should not be a full list of functionality; the Carbon team will work with\r\nyou to define functionality based on the desired UX.\r\n\r\n1.
