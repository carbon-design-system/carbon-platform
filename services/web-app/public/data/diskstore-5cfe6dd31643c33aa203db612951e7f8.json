The SkeletonText component should be based on the current Carbon font settings.\r\n\r\nClarify if you are asking for design, development, or both design and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThis could be achieved by development alone.\r\n\r\n### Justification\r\n\r\nIt looks bad when a font, other than the ones matching the size options, replace the skeleton. It causes pages to vertically jump and is visually distracting.\r\n\r\n### \"Must have\" functionality\r\n\r\nIt must be possible to use a skeleton in place of productive-heading-06 without having to manually configure the height and vertical gaps between lines of text.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/8722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/8722/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1}]}}
