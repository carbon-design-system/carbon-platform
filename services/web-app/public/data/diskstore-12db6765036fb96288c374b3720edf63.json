It would also minimize the amount of space needed to display `time picker` and `single with calendar` side by side, while also creating a mental connection to help our users to understand which date corresponds to which time. \r\n\r\n| With AM & PM | Without AM & PM | \r\n| ----------- | ----------- | \r\n| ![date picker with meridiem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29249866/143887374-5ac4ce4d-1a9f-4446-b8fa-7d59e0de9b09.gif) | ![date picker without meridiem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29249866/143887428-3074788c-0950-4370-bed1-a8ad6b1410fa.gif) | \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Justification\r\n\r\nWhile date picker (and it's variants) work for many use cases, we've noticed that they can become overbearing when shown side by side when used to ask the user for a date and time range. In addition, when `date picker` is currently implemented, a visual disconnect is created between the date and the relevant time. \r\n\r\n| Current Process |\r\n| ----------- | \r\n| ![Current Implementation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29249866/143884015-0c307bec-cfaf-4dbf-ad3b-cfb780537c17.png) |\r\n\r\n| Process with Proposed Enhancement |\r\n| ----------- | \r\n| ![Proposal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29249866/143884142-c1274c21-136c-40ed-8908-54bc04fcd95c.png) | \r\n\r\nSince this would be an enhancement on top of `date picker's` current offering, we are reaching out for development assistance.\r\n\r\n### Desired UX and success metrics\r\n\r\nThe combined date and time enhancement to `Date picker` will provide a visual indicator for users to choose a date and a corresponding time. It's functionality should mirror Carbon's current `date picker` and `time picker`, as it just has been combined into one smaller component.\r\n\r\n**Success metrics:**\r\n\r\n- Users should be able to identify the ability to select a date from a calendar and its corresponding time.\r\n- Change the way a calendar is displayed based on their pre-defined IBM Cloud settings. (A user in Ireland would likely not use AM or PM, thus they should be shown `Date and Time Picker without Meridiem`.\r\n- Warn users when their choice invalid.\r\n\r\n### Required functionality\r\n\r\nThe required functionality should mirror what is currently seen on [the documentation for Date Picker.](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/date-picker/usage) However, one added requirement would be changing the way `time picker` and `date picker` are displayed based on a users predefined settings on IBM Cloud.\r\n\r\nA user in Ireland would likely not use AM or PM, thus they should be shown `Date and Time Picker without Meridiem`.\r\n\r\n### Specific timeline issues / requests\r\n\r\nThree users have asked us for this refined functionality in the past two months. While there is no defined deadline, it would be nice to have as an option. We'd love to work with Carbon to make this happen.\r\n\r\n### Available extra resources\r\n\r\nDesign resources: our team can create usage and style templates, create additional guidance, and help bring this to life!\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources: A developer has agreed to work with Cloud PAL to contribute this as an enhancement to Carbon.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/f555616971a03fd454c0f4daea184adf41fff05b/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10068","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10068/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10068/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10068/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10068","id":1047722893,"node_id":"I_kwDOBQ58z84-cvuN","number":10068,"title":"Date picker - custom range focus state issue ","user":{"login":"votiffany99","id":93011195,"node_id":"U_kgDOBYs8-w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93011195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/votiffany99","html_url":"https://github.com/votiffany99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/votiffany99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/votiffany99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/votiffany99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/votiffany99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/votiffany99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/votiffany99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/votiffany99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/votiffany99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/votiffany99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028595,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20bug%20%F0%9F%90%9B","name":"type: bug 🐛","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1056028601,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NjAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/severity:%204","name":"severity: 4","color":"ffb3b8","default":false,"description":"Affects minor functionality, no workaround needed"},{"id":1354806576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzU0ODA2NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/package:%20react","name":"package: react","color":"d4bbff","default":false,"description":"carbon-components-react"},{"id":1692677532,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkyNjc3NTMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/component:%20date-picker","name":"component: date-picker","color":"a6c8ff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2021-10-28T20:24:45Z","updated_at":"2021-12-13T22:12:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Overview\r\nDate picker - custom range focus state issue: Currently, the focus (blue border) goes back to the start date after user finishes choosing their end date. \r\n\r\n## Detailed description\r\n\r\nWhat version of the Carbon Design System are you using?\r\nCarbon 10\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nFocus should stay on the end date after user chooses the end date \r\n\r\nWhat happened instead?\r\nThe focus goes back to the start date after user finishes choosing their end date\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nUsing [storybook](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-datepicker--range) component as an example \r\n\r\n1.
