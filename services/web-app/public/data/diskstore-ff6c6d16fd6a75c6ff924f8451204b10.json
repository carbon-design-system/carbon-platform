It should be possible to filter the events based on a provided data field (e.g. event type/category)\n\n### \"Must have\" functionality\n\nSupport different granularity of timeseries (hourly, daily, weekly,...).\r\nInclude ability to change color of bars based on data value (e.g. event type)\r\nInclude ability to add label to the floating bars.\n\n### Specific timeline issues / requests\n\nWithin this year\n\n### Available extra resources\n\nI can test and validate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1}]}}
