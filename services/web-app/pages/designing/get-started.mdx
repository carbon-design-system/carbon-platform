## Step 1: Learn about Carbon

By adopting Carbon, designers gain a collection of reusable assets to design websites and user
interfaces quickly and efficiently.

The [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/) governs IBM’s brand story and visual
expression, and Carbon translates the design language into resources for building digital
experiences.

This is done through `elements` such as color tokens, type tokens, and spacing tokens that are meant
to be applied to all sorts of things like websites, banners at conferences, and email templates.
Carbon also applies the design language to product UI through guidance and components.

### Understand the ecosystem

Carbon is a system of systems. At the epicenter lies the `core system`, with elements, assets, code,
design kits, and guidelines intended as a base for the widest variety of situations. These assets
are open source and can be easily extended or adapted.

Teams at IBM also create `local systems` that depend on and extend the core system for specific use
cases.

## Step 2: Access design tools

IBMers should ask their team about which tool they should adopt and follow instructions in the
[Design Toolbox](https://w3.ibm.com/design/toolbox/#/) to procure a software license. Carbon is
supported on Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, and Axure.

## Step 3: Get the design kits

`Design kits` are libraries from Sketch and Figma—and other tools such as Adobe XD and Invision.
They contain components and elements as well as wireframes and guidance to aid designers.

They are also living, breathing documents. This means you’ll automatically get any updates made by
the Carbon team so you don’t need to go back and change any designs to match the latest release. And
when handing off to your developers there won’t be confusion about components and their behaviors.

The following illustration shows how design kits depend on one another.

### Core design kits

Everyone using Carbon should use core design kits as a starting point for building user interfaces.
This brings consistency and speed, allowing teams to focus on solving more specific user tasks. Core
design kits include elements, core components, wireframes, and guidelines.

### Local design kits

Additional design kits compliment and extend Carbon. For example, IBM.com provides components for an
editorial approach. More kits can be found in the [design kit catalog](/design-kits). The kits in
the table below are only offered in Figma.

## Step 4: Review foundational guidance

The following sites provide guidance for creating experiences that are consistent, provide an
interoperability of experience with other offerings, and represent IBM as a company.
