We need the underline for low-vision users to recognize this as a text field. Also loosing the underline makes the element a button-style, which would be confusing. \r\n- Not moving the text position after all. Keeping text 16px away from left of border helps with preserving the form structure. \r\n- Regular text cursor and allows text selecting\r\n- Add `not-editable` icon, icon in PR https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/pull/2710\r\n- Optional tooltip when hovering `not-editable` icon, to provide reason for the field being read-only \r\n- Overflow text in the field will show in tooltip on hover\r\n- Should be considered a state, possible `readonly` attribute\r\n- Follow the standard readonly attribute: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-readonly\r\n\r\n## Design spec (updated May 13)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15144993/57665202-9970fc00-75c0-11e9-9a3f-b628d7b168a9.png)\r\n\r\n## In context explorations: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15144993/57496411-6fee6280-7298-11e9-82cc-71f2b96e0255.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15144993/57496415-75e44380-7298-11e9-8397-3a79fb5e9a75.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/2177/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/2177/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7758","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7758/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7758/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7758/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7758","id":803643691,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MDM2NDM2OTE=","number":7758,"title":"Feedback Form","user":{"login":"rafaelamascaro-star","id":64613838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjEzODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64613838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelamascaro-star","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelamascaro-star","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelamascaro-star/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelamascaro-star/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelamascaro-star/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelamascaro-star/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelamascaro-star/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelamascaro-star/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelamascaro-star/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelamascaro-star/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelamascaro-star/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20enhancement%20%F0%9F%92%A1","name":"type: enhancement üí°","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1056028594,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTk0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/role:%20ux%20%F0%9F%8D%BF","name":"role: ux üçø","color":"82cfff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1056028600,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/role:%20visual%20%F0%9F%8E%A8","name":"role: visual üé®","color":"82cfff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2021-02-08T15:00:51Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T02:07:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Issue description\r\n\r\nCreate a modal for feedbacks forms inside platforms. \r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nRight now we have this behavior, but we would like to make a more consistent and carbon-aligned flow.

Package\n\ncarbon-components, carbon-components-react\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome\n\n### Package version\n\nv10.46.0, v7.46.0\n\n### Description\n\nWhen using a FileUploader inside a Form that is placed within a TableExpandedRow, the page has a large amount of empty space beneath the page content.\r\n\r\nHere is an image demonstrating the empty space beneath our Carbon DataTable:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"Empty space below page\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94187356/141802891-effdbf3c-2cdf-4a7c-b1e8-dd859652b770.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter investigating the issue, it seems to be a CSS problem with a class named `bx--visually-hidden`. After setting `display: none`, or changing `position: absolute` to `position: relative`, the large amount of space disappeared without any other obvious changes to the page visuals.\r\n\r\nHere is an image demonstrating the bottom of our DataTable after making this change:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"Empty space after fix\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94187356/141804863-3f897f13-aa8f-44b3-b031-96c71a805139.png\">\r\n\r\nIn our app, the empty space exists whether you expand any rows or not. In the CodeSandbox example provided, the empty space below the DataTable is not that large until you expand one of the top three rows, at which point you can see that you can scroll down and see the empty space.\n\n### CodeSandbox example\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/gifted-sara-00019?file=/src/index.js\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. You are able to scroll to the bottom of the page, despite the content not taking up the full height of the window.\r\n2. Expand any row (except the last), and scroll to the bottom of the page to see a large amount of empty space below.\r\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/f555616971a03fd454c0f4daea184adf41fff05b/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n- [X] I checked the [current issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) for duplicate problems","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6820","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6820/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6820/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6820/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6820","id":698857331,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2OTg4NTczMzE=","number":6820,"title":"Datatable with selection: No labels or instructions describing what will happen before a change to a form control","user":{"login":"reeteshsingh93","id":46310374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzEwMzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46310374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reeteshsingh93","html_url":"https://github.com/reeteshsingh93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reeteshsingh93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reeteshsingh93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reeteshsingh93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reeteshsingh93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reeteshsingh93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reeteshsingh93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reeteshsingh93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reeteshsingh93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reeteshsingh93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028613,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NjEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20a11y%20%E2%99%BF","name":"type: a11y ‚ôø","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1692677297,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkyNjc3Mjk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/component:%20data-table","name":"component: data-table","color":"a6c8ff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-09-11T05:13:54Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T20:45:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"\r\n\r\n## Title line template: [Title]: Brief description\r\n\r\n- No labels or instructions describing what will happen before a change to a form control\r\n\r\n- When selecting the checkbox as checked, no info to indicate the purpose of the checkbox\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n> Operating system\r\n WIndows 7 and MacOs catalina\r\n\r\n> Browser\r\n\r\nChrome: Version 84.0.4147.89 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\n> Automated testing tool and ruleset\r\n\r\nJaws and Macos accessibility reader \r\n\r\n> Assistive technology used to verify\r\n\r\n## Detailed description\r\n\r\n> What version of the Carbon Design System are you using?\r\nCarbon design V10 via @console/pal: 1.248.0\r\n\r\n \r\n> What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nScreen reader to tells user that the item to be deleted and Delete/Cancel button will be generated on top of the table when the checkbox is ticked.\r\n\r\n> What happened instead?\r\n\r\nWhen selecting the checkbox as checked, no info to indicate the purpose of the checkbox.
