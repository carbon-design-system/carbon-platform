## Checking for known issues

### GitHub

We use GitHub to track our bugs. If you have a bug to report or wish to request a new feature:

1. Use the [libraries catalog](/libraries) to find the library in question
1. From that library, the resources section has a link to its GitHub repository
1. Search for existing issues before opening a new one â€“ there may already be something similar in
   the works

### Carbon website

Please take some time to explore the content on this website before opening an issue. The site is
comprehensive and most guidelines and components are well documented.

## Creating an issue

### GitHub issues

Report bugs, request features, and leave feedback with a GitHub issue. If you're unsure which
repository to use, please open an issue in the
[Carbon monorepo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon).

### GitHub pull requests

If you have a specific fix or contribution, start by generating a pull request in the appropriate
Carbon repository.

## Requests for comment

For changes that are larger in scale, an RFC (request for comment) may be appropriate. Read more
about our [RFC process](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/rfcs).

## Need more help?

If you have more questions about issues or requesting features, there are multiple ways to reach us
at [Contact us](/help/contact-us).
