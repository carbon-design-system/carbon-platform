Till now we had to represent these min and target values numerically somwhere outside the chart. Having a visual representation of this ranges in the cahrt would be much easyer on the eyes.\r\n\r\nRight from the day I found out about Carbon Charts I thought this was a missing feature. I think it's a valuable one. \r\n\r\n### Desired UX and success metrics\r\n\r\n![102998041-a688f780-4526-11eb-9f4a-a540aa27ddc8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10832876/159022166-8466aad1-5728-4f79-99be-3f48f0c699b2.png)\r\n\r\nI would suggest adding the ranges like grafana does. It's looks clean to me.  \r\n\r\nA tooltip should appear if the user hovers over a range. \r\n\r\n### \"Must have\" functionality\r\n\r\nIn order to align this fature with the Meter chart I would suggest using the same types:\r\n\r\n`\r\n\"status\": {\r\n    \"ranges\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"range\": [\r\n          0,\r\n          40\r\n        ],\r\n        \"status\": \"success\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n`\r\n\r\nOr alternatively the config types could be like the ones in Bullet charts:\r\n\r\n`\r\n{\r\n    \"title\": \"Item E\",\r\n    \"group\": \"D3\",\r\n    \"ranges\": [\r\n      350,\r\n      650,\r\n      980\r\n    ],\r\n    \"marker\": 1575,\r\n    \"value\": 400\r\n  },\r\n`\r\n\r\nLastly, beeing able to assign colors to each status would be nice, but not as important in my opinion.\r\n\r\n### Specific timeline issues / requests\r\n\r\nWe currently have several dashboards on the way that could bennefit from this feature. But no rush. \r\n\r\n### Available extra resources\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1162","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1333/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1286","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1286/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1286/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1286/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/1286","id":1115989331,"node_id":"I_kwDOCIbqFM5ChKVT","number":1286,"title":"[Accessibility]: Missing data label on Gauge chart + gradient fill color?","user":{"login":"gdimitrov2","id":43579417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTc5NDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43579417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdimitrov2","html_url":"https://github.com/gdimitrov2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdimitrov2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdimitrov2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdimitrov2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdimitrov2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdimitrov2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdimitrov2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdimitrov2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdimitrov2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdimitrov2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1034494408,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDM0NDk0NDA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/labels/accessibility","name":"accessibility","color":"ffeaa0","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2022-01-27T09:43:25Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T09:52:29Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Contact Details\r\n\r\ngeorgi.dimitrov95@gmail.com\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nBrowser\r\n\r\n### What happened?

The DB2 created three different states for use cases: an initial state, an in-progress state, and an alarming state.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three use cases we need to support the following three states:\r\n1. Normal state with consumption metrics\r\n2. Scaling-in-progress state when the metrics is being calculated\r\n3.
