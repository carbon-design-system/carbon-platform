the issue: \r\n\r\n> What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? \r\n\r\nAs discussed with the team, there are considerable gaps on how Card CTA is currently structured. Some of the highlights:\r\n\r\n- Card CTA is using CardLink under the hood. We have decided that this should be changed to be Card Link CTA, and adjust so that it properly uses the Card Link styles.\r\n- A true Card CTA needs to be created based on Card (not Card Link)\r\n- A number of patches were made in order to align Card / Card Link / CTA as best as possible compared to the Web Components version. A number of `FIXME` comments have been identified in the code base and needs to be addressed when tackling this.\r\n- Should double-check if there are storybook authoring issues, or swap out CardLinkCTA in content block/group components\r\n\r\n> Component(s) impacted? Please include screenshots, or code and relevant URLs.\r\n\r\nCard, CardLink, CTA\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional notes:\r\n\r\n- Original issue https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/issues/5740 was created and closed, but didn't fully address all of the discrepancies\r\n- PR under the expressive sunset attempts to address this, partially in final fixes (in web components), and others in patches as there isn't a clear distinction between Card CTA and Card Link CTA in React yet:
