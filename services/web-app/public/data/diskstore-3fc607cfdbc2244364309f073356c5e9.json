The states for the selectable variant with flush alignment start to get tricky visually. We need to update structured list to only support the flush alignment for the simple variant.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Structured list\r\nThis is an outline of what the modifiers should be per variant:\r\n- **Simple variant**\r\n  - Hang alignment\r\n    - Default size\r\n    - Condensed size\r\n  - Flush alignment\r\n    - Default size\r\n    - Condensed size\r\n- **Selectable variant**\r\n   - Hang alignment\r\n      - Default size\r\n      - Condensed size\n\n### Screenshots\n\n In the newest React storybook, I do not see the props anymore.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCurrently I do not see the props in React for the different alignments, so those should be added in. \n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of

Package\n\ncarbon-components\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome\n\n### Package version\n\nv10.47.1\n\n### Description\n\nThe top level elements of an unordered list have `–` markers that end up outside the bounding box of the list.\r\n\r\nThe marker is added via `:before`:\r\n```css\r\n.bx--list--unordered>.bx--list__item:before {\r\n    content: \"\\002013\";\r\n    left: -1rem;\r\n    position:

ComboBox has onInputChange but no way to know when Enter is pressed ##\r\n\r\nThough documentation claims the ComboBox allows people to enter text not found in the list items, there is no notification that this has occurred. There should be an onSubmit method to allow capture of Text that was in the input field when enter was pressed. If text matches a list item, that becomes selected and onChange is fired.\r\n\r\n## What package(s) are you using?\r\n- [x] carbon-components-react-7.18.0.tgz\r\n- [x] carbon-components-10.18.0.tgz\r\n\r\n## Detailed description\r\n\r\n> I can not determine if the user has pressed enter in the ComboBox input to get its value for the ID I'd used to identify the ComboBox if what the user typed is not in the list.\r\n\r\n> Is this issue related to a specific component? Yes, ComboBox\r\n\r\n> What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? What would you like to\r\n> see changed?
