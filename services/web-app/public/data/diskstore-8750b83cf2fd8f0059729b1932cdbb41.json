Summary\r\n\r\nWe need unique test ids for all components and major areas within the components. This is a first small step in that direction. \r\n\r\n### Justification\r\n\r\nTo enable support of testing automation in applications that consume the PAL library, we are working to provide a dedicated `data-testid` data attribute for each component. This is also needed in order to start creating a testability contract and we would like the carbon library to offer the same support. See discussion here\r\nhttps://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-addons-iot-react/issues/2446\r\n\r\n### Desired UX and success metrics\r\n\r\n1. The Accordion will get a default property and value for the `data-testid` property which is added to the outmost html element, in this case the `ul` element.\r\n2. The AccordionItem will also get a data-testid to the list element, the button and the content area. \r\n3. If the `data-testid` is supplied to the component this id will be used, if not a default value will be used. Internal components will use available testId values from parent to attempt to provide a unique value.\r\n4.
