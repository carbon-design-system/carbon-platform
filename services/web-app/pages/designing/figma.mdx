**v11 themes are now available!** All themes for the v11 libraries are available to IBM's internal
users and the public community. We have leveraged Figmas latest features in this release which may
result in breaking changes to some of our components.

## Get the libraries

#### 1. Sign into Figma using IBM SSO

You should be added to the IBM Figma organization automatically once you sign in. You do not need to
join or request to join any specific team to access the libraries.

#### 2. Turn on the theme libraries

There are four Carbon themes, two light (White and Gray 10) and two dark (Gray 90 and Gray 100).
Each theme lives in its own Figma library. You can turn on as many libraries as you’d like. The v11
theme libraries are now available to IBM’s internal users and the public community. We have
leveraged Figmas latest features in this release which may result in breaking changes to some of our
components.

Inside of a design file, navigate to the **Main menu** panel in the top left of the toolbar (A).
Open the menu and select **Libraries** from the list (B).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

Then in the Libraries modal that appears, find the team called `IBM Design Systems` (C) and switch
the toggle beside a themed library. For example, switch the
`(v11) White Theme - Carbon Design System` to 'on' (D).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

v10 Figma libraries, see [v10 Design Kits](https://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/figma).

#### 3. Turn on additional libraries 

Under the same team, `IBM Design Systems`, you can also turn on the following IBM Design Language
libraries or visit these view-only links.

- Color styles - IBM Design Language
- Hover color styles - IBM Design Language
- Text styles - IBM Design Language
- Icons - IBM Design Language
- Pictograms - IBM Design Language

You may also turn on the IBM Accessibility Design Kit under IBM Accessibility. Finally, you can
enable any product or digital design kits your team uses to extend Carbon as needed.

## Start designing

### Components

Included in the library are all 40 of the Carbon components and their variants. To insert a
component, go to the **Asset** panel and find the component you would like to use. Drag it from the
asset panel onto the canvas.

View the name of the component in the right sidebar. If the component has variants, you'll see
fields underneath the component name to configure the properties and values of that component set.

For more help on how to use Figma components, see the
[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma).

### Grids and Screens

Included in the library is an asset called `Screens`. These screens provide a canvas that can be
configured at the five 2x grid breakpoints. It also includes the 16 column grid both with and
without a left panel grid influencer.

### Color styles

The Carbon color tokens are surfaced in Figma using styles. To apply a color style, select an object
then in the **Styles** menu you can select a style from the Carbon theme libraries or the IBM Design
Language libraries. In addition to applying color styles to objects, you can also apply Color Styles
to Text layers. In addition to the Color style library, we have created a Hover color styles library
to incorporate specific hover colors per color grade.

To learn more about applying color styles in Figma, see the
[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040316193).

### Text styles

To apply a text style, select a text layer, then in the properties panel, choose a text style from
the `(v11) Text styles - IBM Design Language` library depending on which version you are on. Use
color styles to change the color of a text style.

To learn more about applying text styles in Figma, see the
[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957034-Create-and-Apply-Text-Styles#apply).

## Connect

Designers at IBM can join the #figma-guild Slack channel, a community of designers and engineers
creating a fun and safe space for anyone to learn, share, and ask questions about all things Figma.
