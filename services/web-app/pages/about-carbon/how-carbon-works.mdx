## The Carbon ecosystem

Carbon is s system of systems. At the epicenter lies **Carbon’s universal system**, with assets that
can be used as a base for the widest variety of situations. These components, patterns, elements,
and code are also open source and can easily be extended or adapted.

Additionally, teams throughout IBM have been able to abstract components out and create their own
**product and digital systems**. Examples include
[Carbon for IBM.com](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/) and
[Carbon for IBM Products](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/).

![Carbon ecosystem](/about-carbon/ecosystem.png)

If you’re ready to get started with Carbon, check out our guidance for
[designers](/designing/get-started) and [developers](/developing).

Today, we are platforming this system of systems, giving makers both **global visibility and local
lenses**. Our goal is to help makers find assets that comply with platform requirements, are
convenient to implement, and are consistent with design patterns across the company.

For the first time, makers will be able to find and re-use assets across all IBM teams, regardless
of who maintains them.

Additionally, makers can quickly find assets that are compliant with their own product or team
through local lenses.

Head over to the [component catalog](/assets/components) to see the many assets shared between
product and digital teams. Progress on the new platform can be found in our
[roadmap](/about-carbon/platform-roadmap).

## Creating consistency

The Carbon Design System now follows a
[schema](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-platform/blob/main/docs/resource-schemas.md)
to document each resource in a standardized way. This structured information is indexed by Carbon’s
new underlying platform to use in this website and other services.

For the first time, this allows us to consistently classify reusable components and
patterns—regardless of who maintains them. This also helps designers and developers find and access
components, patterns, functions and templates across all IBM teams.

More importantly, we’re giving IBM makers confidence in what they see in Carbon: to understand who
maintains what, see how often each asset is used and where, and ultimately make informed decisions
with Carbon to advance design excellence within their teams.

## The people behind Carbon

Carbon is not just one team. Various groups work together to provide governance, support for our
community of contributors, and clear direction for Carbon as a whole.

### Steering committee

The steering committee consists of Carbon practitioners from teams across IBM and provides direction
for Carbon and its design and development community.

#### Drive impactful human and business outcomes

</Column>
<Column md={6} lg={8}>

The steering committee represents the voice of the customer and business, reflecting the diverse
objectives of the IBM Design and development community. We ensure Carbon Design System delivers
business value, which in turn drives outcomes that people love.

#### Scale design consistency and excellence

</Column>
<Column md={6} lg={8}>

The steering committee provides line of sight into our respective patterns and best practices. By
doing so, we support the community effort to improve the consistency of the human experience. To
scale excellence, we share successes, either from using Carbon, or as input to improving Carbon. As
a committee, we amplify key projects of high potential business value to influence Carbon's
priorities.

#### Grow and strengthen the community

</Column>
<Column md={6} lg={8}>

The steering committee engages our respective networks of collaborators and resources to consume,
contribute to, and innovate Carbon. We feed a virtuous cycle in which Carbon advocacy grows by
freeing Designers and Developers to focus on higher level solutions, which they contribute back into
Carbon.  This increases the internal and external eminence of Carbon Design System and IBM.
