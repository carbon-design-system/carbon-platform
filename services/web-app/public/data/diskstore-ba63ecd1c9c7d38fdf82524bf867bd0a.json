onStateChange,\r\n    selectedItem: controlledSelectedItems,\r\n    items: items\r\n  }))),\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe itemToString part fails due to `items` not being an array. Currently patching with the following:\r\n```\r\nreturn Array.isArray(items) && items.map(function (item) {\r\n        return _itemToString(item);\r\n      }).join(', ') || '';\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne solution might be to remove the event listener from the Select when not filterable, unless there are keys used for opening/closing the menu in which case maybe more specific key down events.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/9938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/9938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10336","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10336/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10336/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10336/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10336","id":1093626304,"node_id":"I_kwDOBQ58z85BL2nA","number":10336,"title":"[Bug]: MultiSelect.Filterable does not render options properly when clearing input via backspace key","user":{"login":"ask-42","id":47505079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTA1MDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47505079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ask-42","html_url":"https://github.com/ask-42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ask-42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ask-42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ask-42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ask-42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ask-42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ask-42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ask-42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ask-42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ask-42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028595,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20bug%20%F0%9F%90%9B","name":"type: bug 🐛","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1354806576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzU0ODA2NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/package:%20react","name":"package: react","color":"d4bbff","default":false,"description":"carbon-components-react"},{"id":1692678911,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkyNjc4OTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/component:%20multi-select","name":"component: multi-select","color":"a6c8ff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2022-01-04T18:04:09Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T03:16:19Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Package\n\ncarbon-components, carbon-components-react\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome\n\n### Package version\n\nlatest (7.50.0, 10.50.0)\n\n### React version\n\n^17.0.2\n\n### Description\n\nWhen typing a filter in the Filterable MultiSelect, and then clearing it by pressing backspace (say you make a typo after typing one character, and then press backspace to delete it, or want to update your filter), it does not render/filter on the '' input value, so the options do not appear until you begin typing a new filter.\r\n\r\nClicking out of the input when it is blank, and then back into it, causes them to reappear, but that requires additional user interaction.\n\n### CodeSandbox example\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/boring-noether-kme19\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Type the letter `a` into the filter, to show just item `a`\r\n2. Press the backspace key to clear the filter\r\n3. No items render. All items (`a`,`b`, and `c`) should render right now based on the default filtering logic, but there is nothing.\r\n4. Clicking out of the input and back in at this point causes them to render properly\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/f555616971a03fd454c0f4daea184adf41fff05b/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n- [X] I checked the [current issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) for duplicate problems","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6699","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6699/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6699/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6699/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6699","id":682481614,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODI0ODE2MTQ=","number":6699,"title":"How to set options with including image for MultiSelect widget","user":{"login":"AngelaChenBJ","id":41713412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzEzNDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41713412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelaChenBJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AngelaChenBJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelaChenBJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelaChenBJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelaChenBJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelaChenBJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelaChenBJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelaChenBJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelaChenBJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelaChenBJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelaChenBJ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2143534559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTQzNTM0NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/status:%20waiting%20for%20maintainer%20response%20%F0%9F%92%AC","name":"status: waiting for maintainer response 💬","color":"002d9c","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2020-08-20T07:16:35Z","updated_at":"2020-09-01T11:50:43Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hello, I'm using MultiSelect widget, and I need to show options with including image like below, it is just a mock example\r\n<img width=\"218\" alt=\"p1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41713412/90728239-25f78780-e2f7-11ea-9f55-7f7d38dc586e.png\">\r\nMy question is how can I set options with including image in MultiSelect widget?\r\nFor MultiSelect widget, we provide items like in following format:\r\n items={[{ id: 'item-1', text: 'Item 1' }, { id: 'item-2', text: 'Item 2' }]}\r\nFor the shown option content, it is from text field as it has the setting itemToString={item => (item ? item.text : '')}\r\nI wonder how to include an image path in text field, so it can parse the image path correct and show image accordingly in the option, I tried to combine image path into text field, but it shows the path directly instead of image, I also tried to put image info into img widget, then combine it into text field along with other information, it also can't show image correctly.
