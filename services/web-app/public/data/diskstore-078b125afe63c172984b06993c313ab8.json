Overcoming this issue is difficult as concept itself relies on contrast to make the selected option obvious to the user.  To add to this difficulty, [accessibility concerns](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6745) have also been raised in regard to the contrast between the content switcher’s unselected items, and the theme backgrounds.  \r\n\r\nA proposed solution is to provide a second content switcher option, which would have a lower visual weight than the original design, but still retains enough contrast to meet WCAG requirements and provide the user with an easily identifiable ‘selected’ state. \r\n\r\nAll of the following designs have been [tested](https://ibm.box.com/s/zw7jy4qkds7ezaaa77qh8qpdlcpuk36w) against the accessibility concerns raised [here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6745) and are compliant with WCAG contrast regulations.  These designs have also been tested to ensure they are as usable as the current design, and that users are able to easily identify which item is selected, even when using the 2-option variant. \r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div ><h2>White Theme</h2>\r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/bbcc4e80-501b-11eb-9307-bca662939608\" width=\"30%\"> \r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/c686e380-501b-11eb-950e-047bb9dbafce\" width=\"30%\">\r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/cbe42e00-501b-11eb-9b38-d42e1e26cd10\" width=\"38%\">\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div ><h2>Grey 10 Theme</h2>\r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/40b76800-501c-11eb-98ff-87d274f73157\" width=\"30%\"> \r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/5167de00-501c-11eb-8475-48dd87ed28b3\" width=\"30%\">\r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/5e84cd00-501c-11eb-994c-a936b67ae149\" width=\"38%\">\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div ><h2>Grey 90 Theme</h2>\r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/8d9b3e80-501c-11eb-8b4b-8ecdfe49125a\" width=\"30%\"> \r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/a146a500-501c-11eb-9390-38ddec0aa808\" width=\"30%\">\r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/ad326700-501c-11eb-8b3e-102881f02a87\" width=\"38%\">\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div ><h2>Grey 100 Theme</h2>\r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/1d41ec80-501f-11eb-9252-994ac0f03785\" width=\"30%\"> \r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/28951800-501f-11eb-97de-3b3ecbddbaf6\" width=\"30%\">\r\n<img src=\"https://media.github.ibm.com/user/287877/files/32b71680-501f-11eb-8ece-83f2b70f3ecb\" width=\"38%\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1}]}}
