## Carbon and IDL bi–weekly design playbacks <span>Fridays, 12pm–1pm Central</span>

_For IBMers only:_ You’ve got some work in progress and you’re ready to open it up and share it with
a broader audience for honest (and caring!) feedback. Verify that you’re working with the grid
correctly, that you’re using the right components, that you’re using the correct language. Sign up
to share, or come along to see other work in progress and learn that way.

## Data visualization weekly playbacks<span>Wednesdays, 10am–11am Central</span>

_For IBMers only:_ Are you designing a product with data visualization needs? These weekly playback
calls are a chance for us to have dataviz stakeholders present, discuss design explorations, gather
feedback and business unit requirements, and determine next steps on requested components or
functionality.

## Design pin–ups <span>Contact us to schedule</span>

_For IBMers only:_ Put your screens up in MURAL and step through the flow and page designs with the
Carbon designers. Great for assessing the overall flow, page layouts, the best choices and use of
components, content—everything from the big picture to the smallest detail! Usually two or more
hours.
