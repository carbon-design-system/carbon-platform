The idea is that if the `<Modal>` is open (*i.e.* its `open` prop is truthy), the class is added; if it is not open, the class is removed. The purpose of the class seems to be to suppress the `<body>` element's scrollbar and prevent scrolling.\r\n\r\nThis works fine when there is only one `<Modal>` on the page, but if there are two, it goes wrong. Suppose they are both closed at first. Then the first `<Modal>` opens. It adds the `.bx--body--with-modal-open` class to the `<body>` element. So far so good.\r\n\r\nNow suppose the second `<Modal>` re-renders. It doesn't *open* - having two `<Modal>`'s open at the same time is frowned upon, as we know - it doesn't even need to change state or props. It just *re-renders*. This causes the second `<Modal>`'s `componentDidUpdate` to get hit. It discovers that its own `open` prop is closed - still - and it obediently removes the `.bx--body--with-modal-open` class from the `<body>` element... even though the first `<Modal>` is still open and the class should still be there.\r\n\r\nIn practical terms this has the effect of making a scrollbar on the overall page disappear and reappear at seemingly random times while the first `<Modal>` is open.\r\n\r\n### CodeSandbox example\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/jolly-rui-d3bps?file=/src/index.js\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nObserve how the sandbox has one `<Modal>` which is closed, but its `modalHeading` prop is oscillating every few seconds. Meanwhile the other `<Modal>` is open. Notice the flickering scrollbar on the right, and also the class `.bx--body--with-modal-open` being repeatedly added to and removed from the `<body>` element of the demo frame.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/f555616971a03fd454c0f4daea184adf41fff05b/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\r\n- [X] I checked the [current issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) for duplicate problems","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10051/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7479","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7479/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7479/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7479/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/7479","id":770246759,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NzAyNDY3NTk=","number":7479,"title":"Inconsistent Modal scrolling behavior ","user":{"login":"fangshih","id":4862573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjI1NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4862573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshih","html_url":"https://github.com/fangshih","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshih/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshih/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshih/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshih/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshih/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshih/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshih/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshih/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshih/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028585,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20question%20%E2%9D%93","name":"type: question ❓","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1056028594,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NTk0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/role:%20ux%20%F0%9F%8D%BF","name":"role: ux 🍿","color":"82cfff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1692677063,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkyNjc3MDYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/component:%20modal","name":"component: modal","color":"a6c8ff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-12-17T17:47:33Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T16:26:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## The modal scrolling position is not reset when the user reopens the modal, and it only happens when the user sets the system text size to large.\r\n\r\n- [X ] `carbon-components`\r\n- [X ] `carbon-components-react`\r\n\r\n## Detailed description\r\n\r\nThis behavior occurs with Windows and Mac both FF and Chrome.

iPhone in Safari, user gets stuck on the close button when they close the `ComposedModal`\r\n\r\nOne thing I did to try to fix this issue on my end, was to pass a function to the `buttonOnClick` prop of the `ModalHeader` component that would set the focus back to the trigger element on modal close. However, the `onBlur` of the `ComposedModal` interferes with this, triggering the `wrapFocus()` and sets the focus to an item within the modal (which at that point is closed).\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54281166/159930948-f1d44af0-1a38-41bf-8a1d-9d4899caccfb.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### WCAG 2.1 Violation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### CodeSandbox example\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Open modal, and swipe to close button on top right corner\r\n3.

Summary\n\nThe Modal guidelines recommend [2 variants of a loading state](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/#loading), however neither are easy to accomplish with the (react) library out of the box.\n\n### Justification\n\nDevelopers should be enabled to achieve the recommended visual states, in the easiest way possible, to enable a consistent UX, as well as improving DX.\n\n### Desired UX and success metrics\n\nThe Modals should have a trivial way of achieving all the properties of the recommended loading states.\r\n\r\n### My proposal\r\n\r\nThe Modals should have a `loading` property that takes 3 values: `\"none\" | \"inline\" | \"overlay\"`, and a `loadingText` property that either shows on the overlay loader (if `loading === \"overlay\")`, or overrides the `submitButtonText` (if `loading === \"inline\"`) and disables the button while `loading !== \"none\"`.\n\n### Required functionality\n\n_No response_\n\n### Specific timeline issues / requests\n\nI think this should be included in the upcoming v11 release.\n\n### Available extra resources\n\nI am happy to attempt my first PR.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this
