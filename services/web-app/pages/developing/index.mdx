## Step 1: Learn about Carbon

Carbon translates the [IBM Design Language](http://www.ibm.com/design/language) into resources for
building digital experiences. Take the time to read the site so that you fully understand what
drives IBM’s design philosophy and principles, and can make informed decisions in your product work.

By adopting Carbon, front-end developers and engineers gain a collection of reusable components to
build websites and user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

### Understand the ecosystem

Carbon is a system of systems. At the epicenter lies the `core system`, with elements, assets, code,
design kits, and guidelines intended as a base for the widest variety of situations. These assets
are open source and can be easily extended or adapted.

Teams at IBM also create `local systems` that depend on and extend the core system for specific use
cases.

## Step 2: Learn about libraries

`Libraries` are the means to contribute, install, and use one or many assets in products and digital
experiences.

In the past, Libraries were scattered across several websites or lived in inaccessible team
documents. By [centralizing libraries](https://next.carbondesignsystem.com/libraries) on the new
Carbon platform, developers and designers no longer have to spend time looking for the right set of
assets.

    <Column lg={7} md={5}>
      Libraries are 1:1 with code packages. All coded assets belong to a library and have a
      maintainer.

      **Find design kits**
    </Column>
    <Column lg={7} md={5}>
      Design kits compatible with coded implementations are easily discoverable in libraries. In
      addition, libraries are a great way to look across a portfolio of assets and read additional
      guidance provided by library maintainers.

### Core libraries

Carbon is built React first, so `Carbon React` is our most up-to-date library where components
included in the `core system` live. Assets in this library are open source and can be easily
extended or adapted. Core components are also offered in other frameworks, including Web Components,
Vue, Angular, and Svelte. These frameworks are mostly community maintained.

  </Column>

### Local libraries

Teams at IBM also create `local systems` that depend on and extend the core system for specific use
cases. For example, IBM.com provides components for an editorial approach and uses
[Web Components](https://next.carbondesignsystem.com/libraries/ibmdotcom-web-components) as their
primary framework. Additional libraries are available in the
[library catalog](https://next.carbondesignsystem.com/libraries).

## Step 3: Get started

Head over to core libraries for guidance to get started with your framework of choice.

## Step 4: Build your first app

We offer tutorials in Angular, React, and Vue to guide you in creating an app with the Carbon Design
System. We’ll teach you the ins and outs of using Carbon components, and introduce web development
best practices along the way. Everyone who completes the tutorial will earn an IBM digital badge.
