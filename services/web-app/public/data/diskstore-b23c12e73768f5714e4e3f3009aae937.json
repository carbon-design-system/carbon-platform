v11 tooltip, we realized the new tooltip implementation was behaving differently, specifically in the case for disabled IconButtons and we had some a11y questions around it. Really, there are 2 behaviors I have questions about. Explaining the issues in detail below:\r\n\r\n1. Pagination buttons have what may be an edge case scenario, where a user will perhaps be hovered on an IconButton just as it becomes disabled. This is because the next & previous buttons will become disabled when there are no longer more pages to go forward to or backward to. In v10, when the next/previous icon button becomes disabled and a user is hovering on it, the tooltip immediately disappears. In v11, this does not happen, the tooltip remains visible even once the button is disabled until you hover over the tooltip.\r\n\r\nAfter a discussion about it last week, Josh helped me come up with a list of possible implementations that would make v11 match v10 behavior (tooltip disappears as soon as the button is disabled). However, we were wondering in terms of a11y if there was any argument for keeping a tooltip on a disabled button or what the best practice would be for this instance. Listing the options we came up with below:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n // Option 0: tooltip on disabled is okay\r\n // Option 0.5: aria-disabled for pagination buttons\r\n\r\n // Option 1: directly sniff child props\r\n // Cons: It assumes that the direct child has the `disabled` prop\r\n // You could have any number of layers between this component and the disabled button\r\n // A -> B -> C -> Button{disabled}\r\n   useEffect(() => {\r\n     if (child.props.disabled) {\r\n       setOpen(false);\r\n     }\r\n   }, [child.props.disabled]);\r\n\r\n // Option 2: let's scan our tree to see if there is something interactive or not\r\n   useEffect(() => {\r\n     const interactiveContent = getInteractiveContent(containerRef.current);\r\n    console.log(interactiveContent);\r\n     if (!interactiveContent) {\r\n       setOpen(false);\r\n     }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n // Option 3: tell us when the underlying button changes\r\n  const buttonRef = useRef(null);\r\n  const triggerProps = {\r\n    ref: buttonRef,\r\n    onFocus: () => setOpen(true),\r\n    onBlur: () => setOpen(false),\r\n    // This should be placed on the trigger in case the element is disabled\r\n    onMouseEnter,\r\n  };\r\n\r\n   useEffect(() => {\r\n     function subscriber(mutationList) {\r\n       mutationList.forEach((mutation) => {\r\n         if (\r\n           mutation.type === 'attributes' &&\r\n           mutation.attributeName === 'disabled' &&\r\n           mutation.target.disabled\r\n         ) {\r\n           setOpen(false);\r\n         }\r\n       });\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     const observer = new MutationObserver(subscriber);\r\n\r\n     observer.observe(buttonRef.current, {\r\n       attributes: true,\r\n       childList: false,\r\n       subtree: false,\r\n     });\r\n\r\n     return () => {\r\n       observer.disconnect();\r\n     };\r\n   }, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In addition to that, I noticed that there is another behavior that is inconsistent in our v10 and v11 IconButton . In v10 pagination, when you are hovered on any of the next/prev buttons, the tooltip disappears after the first click. So even if you stayed hovered over it, and are clicking forward to move pages, it doesn’t show up again after the first activation of the button. However, in v11, the tooltip stays up the whole time. I’m wondering in terms of a11y, what is expected to happen?\r\n\r\n### WCAG 2.1 Violation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### CodeSandbox example\r\n\r\nsee videos below\r\n\r\n### Steps to

The difference is most jarring on short and compact row heights.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for development support to add at least a 32px pagination bar height. \r\n\r\nIdeally we would have matching pagination and toolbar heights for any row height, but adding the 32px pagination bar is an excellent MVP.\r\n\r\n**As-Is**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/121440640-e9604f80-c94d-11eb-8460-f1fd525bc6d2.png)\r\n\r\n**Proposed**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/121440667-f3824e00-c94d-11eb-8693-c9482f39b46a.png)\r\n\r\n### Justification\r\n\r\nWe are rolling out the table settings feature more widely, which means that these alternative heights will begin to be more heavily used, making this visual inconsistency more obvious. \r\n\r\nAdding an additional pagination bar height will allow us to create visual harmony with minimal effort.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 6 13 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39408106/121440923-74414a00-c94e-11eb-8587-32d7a9cbf476.png\">\r\n\r\n### Desired UX and success metrics\r\n\r\nWhen user switches to either a short (xs) or compact (sm) row height, the pagination bar would switch to a small height (32px). \r\n\r\nSame for data table toolbar - see related request [Provide data table toolbar heights to match new row heights #8875](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/8875)\r\n\r\n### \"Must have\" functionality\r\n\r\nEach of the pagination bar variations would have a 32px version.\r\n\r\n### Specific timeline issues / requests\r\n\r\nIdeally it would be great to roll this out with Carbon 11 as we introduce the new row heights.
