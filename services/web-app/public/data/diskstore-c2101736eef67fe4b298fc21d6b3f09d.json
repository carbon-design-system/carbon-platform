The DB2 went ahead and created our own gauges to show proportion of resource consumption. \r\nKnowing how the system is doing at all time is one of the critical responsibilities of our key target persona. Our users demanded the detailed information to better understand what is taking up the  memory. If they are running out of the memory, they must scale up the core to prevent the system failure due to the lack of memory. \r\n\r\nBelow is an example of the order of the mental processing: \r\nWhat is it (title)?\r\nWhat does it mean (title definition)?\r\nWhat is the total amount? \r\nHow much was being used?\r\nHow much was available?\r\nWhat was taking up the memory?\r\n\r\nThe current CX lacks component to support our use cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld design:\r\n![gauge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63752979/80737929-185c8e80-8ac9-11ea-9ea8-df6e8ff1167b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew design:\r\n<img width=\"993\" alt=\"multi-color-gauge\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63752979/80737855-f82ccf80-8ac8-11ea-8350-dc7c28128945.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1}]}}
