The first option in the combo box, the aggregate of all store data, is selected by default. From there, users can open the combo box to search and select specific stores. The data would then refresh to show stats specific to that store.\r\n\r\nThe issue we are having is that the \"X\" is visible when the default option (the aggregate) is selected. Nothing happens when the user selects \"X\" because it's already in the default state. [See video](https://ibm.box.com/s/e5dx9r4qaof6949o9g2g31p5yw0v4sdl)\r\n\r\nI am asking for development.\r\n\r\n### Justification\r\n\r\nIt's a confusing user experience to have the \"X\" present when the combo box is already in its default state. \r\n\r\n### Desired UX and success metrics\r\n\r\n<!--alex disable failure-->\r\n\r\nWhat happens today (as-is):\r\nThe \"X\" shows by default because the default selection (the aggregate) is selected. Selecting \"X\" has no outcome.\r\n\r\nThe ideal experience as discussed by the SFO team (to-be):\r\nRemove the \"X\" by default because it doesn't have a functional purpose. It can cause confusion for the user. \r\n\r\n<!--alex enable failure-->\r\n\r\n### \"Must have\" functionality\r\n\r\nOur ideal would be to remove the \"X\" when there is a default selection.\r\n\r\n### Specific timeline issues / requests\r\n\r\n<!--alex disable period-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--alex enable period-->\r\n\r\nIt has been releases as-is, so preferably sooner rather than later. \r\n\r\n### Available extra resources\r\n\r\nThere might be development resources from SFO that could help, but I'd have to reach out to Chetan Jadhav to verify. There are two SFO UX designers that could help if needed. \r\n\r\nNote: This issue was originally raised in [Carbon Angular #1430\r\n](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/issues/1430)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/9715","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/9715/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/9715/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/9715/events","html_url":"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/9715","id":1003885283,"node_id":"I_kwDOBQ58z8471hLj","number":9715,"title":"Focus not visible when user navigated to currently selected option in combo-box","user":{"login":"minnekanti","id":16116659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTE2NjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16116659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minnekanti","html_url":"https://github.com/minnekanti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minnekanti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minnekanti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minnekanti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minnekanti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minnekanti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minnekanti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minnekanti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minnekanti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minnekanti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1056028616,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU2MDI4NjE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/type:%20discussion%20%F0%9F%92%AC","name":"type: discussion üí¨","color":"3ddbd9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1382571883,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzgyNTcxODgz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/package:%20components","name":"package: components","color":"d4bbff","default":false,"description":"carbon-components"},{"id":1692676824,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkyNjc2ODI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/component:%20combobox","name":"component: combobox","color":"a6c8ff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3010846448,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDEwODQ2NDQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carbon-design-system/carbon/labels/package:%20styles","name":"package: styles","color":"d4bbff","default":false,"description":"@carbon/styles"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2021-09-22T06:40:09Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T17:30:32Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
